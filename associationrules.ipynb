    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the \"hw5_data.csv\" dataset provided on Carmen to find potential association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "1.    Practice the Association Analysis content we covered this semester.\n",
    "2.    Understand “why” the particular topics, techniques, etc., are important from a practical perspective.\n",
    "3.    Understand how to choose and use appropriate tools to solve the provided problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "- This workbook contains is a market basket dataset containing 50 transactions, drawing from a universe of six items: Apples, Bananas, Carrots, Donuts, Eggs, Fish.  For simplicity, use the short form “A, B, C, D, E, F” for the items.\n",
    "- There is one csv file that captures the data in \"long format\". Specifically, every row corresponds to the transaction id and the item. If the specific transaction id has multiple items, you will have multiple rows in your data.\n",
    "- You can use it however you like but it is recommended you convert into the one-hot-encoded datastructure we used in class. This will allow you to easily use the mlxtend package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proper answers\n",
    "- To make everyone's lives a little easier, when writing itemsets and rules, please list them in lexagraphical order:\n",
    "  {A}, {B}, {A,B}, {A,C}, {A,B,C},…\n",
    "  {A,B,C}->{D}, {A,B}->{C,D}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "For this assignment, you should work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, but your work should be your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need to turn in:\n",
    "1)\tTurn in this Jupyter Notebook BOTH in notebook format and in html format. Failure to submit one or the other will result in points being deducted.\n",
    "  - Submit your hw as HW5_Surname_DotNumber.zip\n",
    "  \n",
    "2)  Feel free to use the **mlxtend** package to help to help enumerate all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  If the question asks you to compute all possible rules, back up the calculation with a \"formula\" approach as well (similar to how we did in class/slides). This will act as \"showing your work\".\n",
